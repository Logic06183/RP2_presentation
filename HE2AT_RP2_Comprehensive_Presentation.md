## Executive Summary

This presentation synthesizes findings from the HE2AT Center's Research Project 2, focusing on urban heat vulnerability and health impacts in major African cities, with primary emphasis on Johannesburg, South Africa, and comparative analysis with Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

### Key Highlights
- **23 harmonized studies** across two major African cities
- **20,962 total participants** in comprehensive health research
- **Novel methodological framework** combining geographically weighted approaches with machine learning

## 1. Research Context & Problem Statement

### The Global Challenge
- **3-6°C** temperature increase projected by 2100 under high emissions scenarios
- **6°C** temperature differential between urban townships and suburbs
- **0.9%** mortality increase per 1°C above 18.7°C threshold
- **2.1%** elderly mortality increase per 1°C temperature rise

### Research Gaps Addressed
- Limited heat-health research in Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) urban contexts
- Siloed approaches that miss complex vulnerability patterns
- No predictive frameworks specifically designed for African cities
- Insufficient integration of socio-spatial inequality analysis
