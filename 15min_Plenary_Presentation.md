# Heat Waves, Air Pollution & Health in Africa
## HE2AT Research Project 2: Initial Findings from Johannesburg & Abidjan

**15-Minute Plenary Session**  
**Panellist: Matthew Chersich (HE2AT)**  
**DSI-Africa Conference 2025**

## Slide 1: Title & Context (1 min)
**Heat Waves, Air Pollution & Health in Africa**
- HE2AT Center Research Project 2
- Craig Parker, PhD Candidate (Wits School of Public Health)
- Initial findings from 23 harmonized studies
- Focus: Johannesburg & Abidjan comparative analysis

---

## Slide 2: The Challenge (2 min)
**Climate Reality in African Cities**
- 3-6°C temperature increase projected by 2100
- 6°C temperature differential between townships & suburbs
- 2.1% elderly mortality increase per 1°C rise
- Limited research in African urban contexts

**Key Gap:** No comprehensive heat-health frameworks for African megacities

---

## Slide 3: Study Overview - Data Landscape (3 min)
**23 Studies, 20,962 Participants Across Two Major African Cities**

### Johannesburg (High Heat Risk)
- 15 studies, 11,800 participants (56.3%)
- Subtropical Highland (1,753m elevation)
- Peak heat: Dec-Feb (Summer)
- Moderate Urban Heat Island

### Abidjan (Very High Heat Risk)  
- 8 studies, 9,162 participants (43.7%)
- Tropical Savanna (76m elevation)
- Peak heat: Feb-Apr (Dry season)
- Severe Urban Heat Island

## Slide 4: Research Portfolio Composition (2 min)
**Diverse Health Research Ecosystem**

**Study Types:**
- Clinical Trials: HIV/TB, COVID-19 vaccines
- Cohort Studies: Birth to Twenty Plus, MASC
- Prevention Trials: PrEP, TB prevention
- Community Programs: Linkage to care

**Research Partners:**
- ACTG, WRHI, DPHRU, VIDA, PACCI
- International collaboration across institutions

---

## Slide 5: Initial Findings - Heat Exposure Patterns (3 min)
**Differential Climate Vulnerability**

**Johannesburg Profile:**
- Research ratio: 1.3x more participants than Abidjan
- Moderate heat stress with high vulnerability
- Winter heating vs summer cooling challenges
- Altitude provides some temperature moderation

**Abidjan Profile:**
- Higher baseline temperatures year-round
- Severe urban heat island effects
- Limited cooling infrastructure
- Coastal humidity compounds heat stress

**Key Insight:** Similar participant burden despite different climate zones

---

## Slide 6: Data Integration Approach (2 min)
**Comprehensive Multi-Domain Framework**

**Health Data:**
- 7,000-9,000 individual clinical records
- Cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory markers
- Heat-sensitive physiological indicators

**Environmental Data:**
- Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS)
- Land surface temperature measurements
- Urban heat island mapping

**Socioeconomic Data:**
- GCRO Quality of Life Surveys (135 Johannesburg wards)
- Housing quality, healthcare access
- Infrastructure availability

---

## Slide 7: Methodological Innovation (1 min)
**Three-Phase Sequential Approach**

1. **Vulnerability Mapping** (Descriptive)
   - Geographically weighted approaches
   - Spatial heterogeneity analysis

2. **Heat-Health Dynamics** (Explanatory) 
   - Machine learning + causal inference
   - SHAP/LIME interpretation

3. **Predictive Modeling** (Predictive)
   - Ensemble methods
   - 24-72 hour forecasting

---

## Slide 8: Next Steps & Impact (1 min)
**From Analysis to Action**

**Immediate Outputs:**
- Spatially explicit vulnerability maps
- Evidence-based intervention targeting
- Predictive early warning capabilities

**Broader Applications:**
- Scalable to other African cities
- Climate adaptation planning
- Health system preparedness

**Timeline:** 36-month PhD with quarterly milestones
