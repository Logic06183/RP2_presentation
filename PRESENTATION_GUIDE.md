### 🔥 Key Messages

**Johannesburg:**
- Subtropical highland climate (elevation 1,753m)
- Pronounced seasonal variation (5-35°C range)
- Dry heat extremes in summer months
- ~25 extreme heat days >35°C annually
- Better existing adaptation infrastructure
- Vulnerable to rapid temperature changes

**Abidjan:**
- Tropical wet climate at sea level
- Consistently high temperatures (22-35°C)
- High humidity creates heat stress at lower temperatures
- ~120 heat stress days annually
- Higher proportion of vulnerable populations
- Limited cooling infrastructure

**Health Impacts:**
- Heat-related mortality increases exponentially above 35°C (JHB) and 32°C+humidity (ABJ)
- Children <5 and adults >65 most vulnerable
- Outdoor workers face daily occupational heat stress
- Economic costs: healthcare, productivity loss, infrastructure

**Adaptation Needs:**
1. Early warning systems for extreme heat events
2. Public cooling centers and green spaces  
3. Heat-resilient building standards
4. Healthcare system preparedness
5. Real-time heat-health surveillance

### 💡 Presentation Tips

1. **Start Strong**: Use title slide to establish expertise
2. **Build Credibility**: Show real data analysis first
3. **Tell a Story**: Connect climate patterns to human impact
4. **Be Specific**: Use actual numbers and projections
5. **End with Action**: Clear recommendations for next steps

### 📈 Supporting Statistics

- **Temperature Ranges**: JHB 5-35°C vs ABJ 22-35°C
- **Heat Days**: JHB 25/year extreme vs ABJ 120/year stress
- **Population at Risk**: JHB 2.5M vs ABJ 4.5M vulnerable
- **Economic Impact**: JHB $140M vs ABJ $150M annually
- **Future Projections**: 2-3x increase in extreme heat days by 2050

### 🌍 Global Context

These cities represent broader African urbanization challenges:
- Rapid population growth in heat-prone regions
- Limited climate adaptation resources  
- Need for heat-health early warning systems
- Integration of climate and health data systems
