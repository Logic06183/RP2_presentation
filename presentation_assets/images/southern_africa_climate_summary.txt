## Climate Zone Analysis

### MALAWI
Dominant Climate: Tropical Wet Savanna (Aw) - 74.1% coverage
- Characteristics: Hot, wet summers with distinct dry season
- Precipitation: High seasonal variation, wet season Nov-Apr
- Temperature: Consistently warm, minimal seasonal variation
- Climate vulnerability: #26 most vulnerable globally (ND-GAIN)
- Recent changes: +1.0°C since 1980s, increased precipitation variability

Secondary Climate: Cold Semi-Arid (BSk) - 25.9% coverage
- Highland areas with cooler temperatures
- Lower precipitation, more drought-prone

### SOUTH AFRICA  
Dominant Climate: Cold Desert (BWk) - 47.4% coverage
- Characteristics: Arid conditions with cold winters
- Precipitation: Very low, highly variable
- Temperature: Large diurnal and seasonal variations
- Climate vulnerability: #117 most vulnerable globally (ND-GAIN)
- Recent changes: +1.2°C since 1980s, progressive drying in west

Most Diverse Climate Profile: 11 different climate zones
Other significant zones:
- Cold Semi-Arid (BSk) - 43.8%: Interior plateau regions
- Humid Subtropical (Cfa) - 3.1%: Eastern coastal areas
- Tropical Wet Savanna (Aw) - 2.6%: Northern regions

### ZIMBABWE
Dominant Climate: Tropical Wet Savanna (Aw) - 57.4% coverage  
- Characteristics: Distinct wet/dry seasons, moderate temperatures
- Precipitation: Concentrated in summer months (Nov-Mar)
- Temperature: Moderated by elevation
- Climate vulnerability: #51 most vulnerable globally (ND-GAIN)
- Recent changes: +1.0°C since 1980s, erratic rainfall patterns

Secondary Climates:
- Cold Desert (BWk) - 22.5%: Western regions
- Cold Semi-Arid (BSk) - 20.1%: Central plateau

## Key Climate-Health Implications

### Precipitation Patterns & Health Risks:
1. **Malawi & Zimbabwe** (Tropical Savanna): 
   - Seasonal flooding/drought cycles affect water security
   - Vector-borne disease patterns follow rainfall
   - Food security tied to precipitation reliability

2. **South Africa** (Cold Desert/Semi-Arid):
   - Water scarcity as primary health risk
   - Heat stress in arid regions
   - Urban heat islands in metropolitan areas

### Temperature Rises & Adaptation:
- All three countries show ~1.0-1.2°C warming since 1980s
- South Africa most vulnerable to further warming (arid baseline)
- Highland areas (BWk/BSk zones) provide some thermal refugia

### Development Context:
- Economic capacity for adaptation varies dramatically (GDP: $520-$6,023)
- Health system strength correlates with income level
- Urban vs rural populations face different climate exposures

## World Bank Climate Data Integration Opportunities:

Based on dominant climate zones identified:
1. **Temperature data**: Daily min/max for BWk, BSk, Aw zones
2. **Precipitation data**: Seasonal patterns, variability indices
3. **Extreme events**: Heat wave frequency, drought indices
4. **Agricultural climate**: Growing degree days, water stress indicators
